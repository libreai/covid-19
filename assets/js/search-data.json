The respective population of Ireland, Italy, and Spain is as follows (in millions) [source]: . Ireland : 4.9M | Italy : 60.2M | Spain : 47.1M | . If we plot a figure dividing the total number of cases reported daily by the population (in millions) we can find how many persons are infected per 1 million, which give us a normalized value we could use to understand the severity of the outbreak. . The figure below shows that in fact Ireland has more cases per million than the most affected countries in Europe starting on March 16th, 2020, and growing quickly. . . Data Sources .
