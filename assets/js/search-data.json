            "content": "Last updated on 2020-03-23 7: 30 PM IST . . Total Confirmed: 1125 . Total Deaths: 6 . Total Recovered: 5 . . . Important: Starting on March 16th, 2020, Ireland has more #COVID19 cases per million (and growing quickly) than the most affected countries in Europe, Italy and Spain, at their early stages. . Number of persons tested positive for Covid-19 in Ireland . The figure below shows the total number of persons who tested positive for Covid-19 (cases) in Ireland, Italy, and Spain. The x axis corresponds to the number of days since at least 10 cases were detected. This allow us to compare Ireland&#39;s current situation to the observed in Italy and Spain earlier. The comparison using Italy and Spain is because those countries are still in a critical situation fighting the pandemia, and no country would like to be the next one in such situation. . For Ireland, the size of the circles for each day denotes the number of new persons confirmed infected that day. . If we consider only the absolute numbers, we can see that the confirmed cases for Covid-19 in Ireland are below the ones observed in Italy and Spain at early stages. However, the populations of the three countries are very different and we have to account for that as well. . . Number of Covid-19 cases per million . The respective population of Ireland, Italy, and Spain is as follows (in millions) [source]: . Ireland : 4.9M | Italy : 60.2M | Spain : 47.1M | . If we plot a figure dividing the total number of cases reported daily by the population (in millions) we can find how many persons are infected per 1 million, which give us a normalized value we could use to understand the severity of the outbreak. . The figure below shows that in fact Ireland has more cases per million than the most affected countries in Europe starting on March 16th, 2020, and growing quickly. . . Data Sources .
